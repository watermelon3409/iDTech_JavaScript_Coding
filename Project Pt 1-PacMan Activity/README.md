# Project Pt 1 - PacMan Activity
If you've ever played an arcade game, then you're familiar with Pac-Man! This is the game where the player controls PacMan who travels inside a maze trying to eat all the dots while avoiding the colorful ghosts. You're not going to build the full PacMan game in this activity. However, you will be building a feature of this game, which displays and moves PacMan from one side of the screen to the other.

1. Add a setInterval call to run every 200 milliseconds.
2. Update checkPageBounds to reverse Pac-Man direction upon hitting the edge of the screen.
