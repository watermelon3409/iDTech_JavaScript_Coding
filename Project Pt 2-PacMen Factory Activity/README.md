Your task in this activity is to create a PacMan on demand (button click) and move these PacMen across the page:

By the end, you should have results similar to the video page referenced below. You can navigate to the video to review the project description. This video is located in Section 5: Pre-Class Videos.

Here's how the game is played:

When you click the "Add PacMan" button, a new PacMan should appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the "Start Game" button, the PacMan or PacMen created should start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given Pacman hits the edge of the screen, it should change position to stay within the frame of the web page.
